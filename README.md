I have made a web application that allows to place orders online by writing a client file 
and a server that will be comunication in order for the the webpage to run properly. 

The server will load all the JSON files in start and store them in dictionaries and will 
send data to the client on their requests (GET) and will update the values of various 
components that the client will be sending to the server using (POST)

...This is basically an implementation of how to make aback end server and link it to a 
webpage


How to Run server:
1."npm install"
2."npm start"

	OR
3.Directly Run:
	"node server.js"
4.Then go to the browser and go to localhost:3000/
